## Quick Start

### 1 - Install Linux
#### Ubuntu 16.04

Start with a clean and minimal install of a Linux system. DevStack attempts to support the two latest LTS releases of Ubuntu, the latest/current Fedora version, 
CentOS/RHEL 7, as well as Debian and OpenSUSE.

### 2- Install OpenStack
#### Version: Ocata

DevStack is a series of extensible scripts used to quickly bring up a complete OpenStack environment based on the latest versions of everything from git master. It is used interactively as a development environment and as the basis for much of 
the OpenStack projectâ€™s functional testing.
