############## Due to the lack of a floating IP to be associated with the VMs, it was necessary to redirect ports to access the applications. ###########

Redirection of physical machine/controller ports to an application that is running on the VM.

IP_Controller: 150.161.121.195
IP_VM: 192.168.120.4

modprobe iptable_nat
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens160 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 150.161.121.195 -p tcp --dport 11081 -j DNAT --to 192.168.120.4:2377
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.120.4 -p tcp --dport 2377 -j SNAT --to 150.161.121.195


Every request that arrives at the controller's 150.161.121.195 port 11081 is redirected to the application that is running on the virtual machine 192.168.120.4 on the port 2377
